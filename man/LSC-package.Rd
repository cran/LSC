\title{Local Statistical Compelxity - Automated Pattern Discovery in Spatio-Temporal Data}
\description{
  A package to estimate local statistical complexity (LSC),
  a measure for automated pattern discovery in
  spatio-temporal data using optimal predictors (see
  References).

  This package is very tightly linked to the \pkg{LICORS}
  package, which can be used to estimate these optimal
  predictors and state space from data. The \pkg{LSC}
  builds on a known or estimated state space; most
  estimation is handled by \pkg{LICORS} (see
  \code{?LICORS}).

  There are two ways the state space can be represented:
  either as a unique state label or as a vector of weights.
  These two are the principal arguments in the functions of
  this package: \describe{ \item{\code{weight_matrix}}{an
  \eqn{N \times K} matrix, where \eqn{N} are the samples
  and \eqn{K} are the states. That is, each row contains a
  vector of length \eqn{K} that adds up to one (the mixture
  weights).} \item{\code{state_vector}}{a vector of length
  \eqn{N} with entry \eqn{i} being the label \eqn{k = 1,
  \ldots, K} of PLC \eqn{i}} }

  This is an early release: some function names and
  arguments might/will (slightly) change in the future, so
  regularly check with new package updates.

## known predictive state space with a state-vector
data(contCA00)
ll <- states2LSC(state_vector = contCA00$predictive_states - min(contCA00$predictive_states) + 
    1)

# An example using estimates from LICORS
\dontrun{

  The main functions in this package are \itemize{ \item
  \code{\link{states2LSC}} to estimate LSC from the state
  space, and \item \code{\link{LICORS2LSC}} which is a
  wrapper for estimating LSC from a \code{"LICORS"} class
  estimate. } Since pattern discovery without visualization
  is only of very limited use, the \code{\link{plot.LSC}}
  function shows informative plots for \eqn{(1+1)D} and
  \eqn{(2+1)D} systems.
